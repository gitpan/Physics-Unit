Revision history for Perl extension Physics::Unit.

0.02
  - Added the prefixes "semi" and "demi", for 0.5.
  - Added the binary prefixes; see
    http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/binary.html
  - Added 'revolution', 'revolutions', and 'rpm'.
  - Added 'cycle' and 'cycles'.
  - Added 'degrees-rankine'
  - Removed some old code that was commented out.
  - Moved implementation-specific comments, including private method
    documentation, into UnitImpl.pm.
  - Added the "EXPRESSION GRAMMAR" section to Unit.pm.
  - Moved documentation about Scalar.pm private methods into
    ScalarImpl.pm.

  - Added "pica" and "point" units to Unit.pm
  - Also added "stone" and "stones"
  - Also added jeweler's units 'carat', 'carats', 'karat', 'karats',
    and 'j-point'.
  - Added a section to the Unit.pm documentation:  "Naming Conflicts
    and Resolution".  This describes all of the instances of units
    names that have multiple definitions (e.g. "point") and how each
    is resolved in this library.
  - Improved the documentation of the unit expression grammar.
  - Re-organized, slightly, the documentation of private methods in the
    Unit.pm module.
  - Re-organized, slightly, the documentation in the Scalar.pm module.
  - Changed *all* the files' newline format from DOS to Unix.
  - Updated the README file.

  - Unit.pm Documentation
    - Removed the "COMPILE-TIME STUFF" header and the associated
      paragraph.
    - InitBaseUnit() is showing up both under "Class Data" and
      "Public Utility Functions".  I removed it from the former.
    - Ditto for InitPrefix(), InitTypes(), InitUnit(), and
      GetUnit().  Gene:  was there some reason that I'm not seeing for
      including these under "Class Data"?
    - Added some of the grammar back into the documentation for the
      Parser methods.

  - Scalar.pm Documentation
    - I added the header "IMPLEMENTATION NOTES" two paragraphs after
      the "DEBUG OPTION" header, since the following paragraphs there
      aren't related to the debug option.
    - I took the ScalarFactory() function out of "PUBLIC METHODS", and
      put it under "PUBLIC UTILITY FUNCTIONS" (a new heading).
